The project aims to:
Improve Early Detection: Develop an AI model that analyzes MRI images to identify breast cancer at earlier stages than traditional methods.
Utilize Deep Learning: Implement deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for accurate feature extraction and classification of tumors.
Validate Performance: Train and validate the model using a diverse dataset of MRI images, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
Clinical Integration: Collaborate with healthcare professionals to create user-friendly tools for radiologists, facilitating seamless integration into clinical workflows.
Enhance Patient Outcomes: Ultimately, the project seeks to improve patient outcomes through earlier diagnosis and personalized treatment plans.
